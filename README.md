# Landing-Page

This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to create a basic landing page.
Flexbox was utilized to assist with formatting within the webpage along with common
functions found in nearly all webpages.

Levy's Hoagies is not a real company. It is something made up by my college roomate
while doing work together. Do not attempt to order any hoagies from him. Anyone who
offers hoagies under the guise of Levy's Hoagies is almost certainly attempting to
scam you.
